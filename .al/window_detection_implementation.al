# AgentLang Program: RustDesk Window Detection Mobile Feature
# Component: flutter
# Reference: /home/filipp/promenade/project-specification.md
#
# This program implements a simplified mobile app based on RustDesk that provides
# window-specific remote interactions through edge detection, carousel selection,
# and swipe-based navigation.
#
# TESTING APPROACH: Uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) with unit tests only.
# No end-to-end testing due to environment constraints. Each component is
# individually validated with comprehensive unit tests before integration.

# Load the comprehensive specification document as our foundation
specification = io:read_file("/home/filipp/promenade/project-specification.md")

# Break down the implementation into parallel development tracks
implementation_tracks = breakdown:parallel(specification)

# Create detailed development plan for the chosen track  
development_plan = breakdown:tree(select:filter(evaluate:vote(implementation_tracks), implementation_tracks))

# Draft the core detection service implementation
detection_service = act:draft(development_plan)

# Draft the state management system
state_manager = act:draft(development_plan) 

# Draft the carousel selection interface
carousel_interface = act:draft(development_plan)

# Draft the window navigation system
navigation_system = act:draft(development_plan)

# Draft the RemotePage integration
remote_page_integration = act:draft(development_plan)

# Evaluate all drafted components for consistency and completeness
component_evaluation = evaluate:vote(detection_service, state_manager, carousel_interface, navigation_system, remote_page_integration)

# Select the best integrated implementation approach
final_architecture = select:filter(component_evaluation, detection_service, state_manager, carousel_interface, navigation_system, remote_page_integration)

# Implement the complete window detection feature
window_detection_implementation = act:implement(final_architecture)

# Apply TDD approach: Create comprehensive unit tests for each component
detection_service_tests = act:draft(detection_service)
state_manager_tests = act:draft(state_manager) 
carousel_interface_tests = act:draft(carousel_interface)

remote_integration_tests = act:draft(remote_page_integration)

carousel_test_results = evaluate:test(carousel_interface_tests)
